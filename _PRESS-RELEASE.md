There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  'ShopBubble'

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Gamifying grocery-shopping

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Creating a shopping-list helps to save money, because it will prevent impulse buying, you will waste less food by planning everything out. But what if your shopping-list apps are too boring and you simply stop using them and get tired of looking for better ones? What about if your simple shopping-list app would be a little bit gamified and more beautiful to look at?
  Your list items will be colorful bubbles, that fill up your screen, and each time you want to remove the item - you just pop that bubble with a simple touch of finger.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Many shopping-list apps are boring and not always easy to use. And then you are tired of this poorly-built app and have to go looking for a better one. But who has time for that?

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  This app would be very simple: you sign in to your account, where all your list information is saved. When you're ready to shop - simply look at the colorful bubbles on the screen which represent the items and pop them whenever you've picked the item. This popping aspect will gamify your experience. You might enjoy creating lists more than usually, and shopping might be not so boring anymore.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  'Bubblify your shopping experience'

  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Sign up, create bubbles and pop bubbles for your pleasure.

## Customer Quote ##

  Your shopping experience is just a bubble away!
